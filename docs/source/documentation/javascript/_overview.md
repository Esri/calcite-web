Calcite Web includes a small (5KB gzipped) JavaScript library. `calcite-web.js` is a lightweight and dependency-free library made to enable interactive behaviors for certain [patterns](../patterns/) and [components](../components).

Currently, the following components and patterns rely on `calcite-web.js`:

- [Dropdowns](../components/#dropdowns)
- [Modals](../patterns/#modals)
- [Tabs](../patterns/#tabs)
- [Accordions](../patterns/#accordions)

The JavaScript library also includes helpers for "sticky" positioning and scroll events. You can read more about these in the [interactive layout helpers](../grid/#interactive-layout-helpers) section of the documentation.
