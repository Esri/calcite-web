Labels for form elements should describe what the field is. Labels should **not** be followed by a semicolon. Placeholder text should describe the specifics about formatting or examples for the input text. Placeholder text is optional, and should never be used to replace a label.

Required form fields should be have the `required` attribute. While *optional* form fields should be clearly marked with "(optional)".

Try not to include too many optional fields, as it will make the form harder to comprehend and complete for the user.
