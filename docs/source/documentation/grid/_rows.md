Because columns can now be nested without changing their behavior, we don't need rows, really. However, you still may find that a tall, narrow column with a short wide neighbor can cause float issues with subsequent columns.

With this grid you can wrap the first two columns in a 24 column grid, which will act in the same manner as a row.
