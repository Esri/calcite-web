## Pre and Post

Pre and Post classes are used to move your columns laterally across the grid by defining how many columns they should be from their neighbors on either side.

Pre and Post classes do not responsively fold. This prevents a `pre-5` from pushing content off the edge of the screen on phone sizes.
