The width of elements can be explicitly defined for breakpoints where columns would normally fold by default. This can be done with the `phone-column-n` and `tablet-column-n` classes. For example, `.column-12` would default to the full 12/12 column width at a tablet size. Adding to the same element `.tablet-column-6` would prevent the default behavior, and at a tablet viewport, the element would be 6/12 columns.
